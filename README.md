- 👋 ** I am a Technical Program Manager by profession, with a strong background in product development and applied Machine Learning projects leading diverse cross functional teams for delivering enterprise level products.

- 👀  Passionate about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and its application in modern day product development, I came a log way educating myself in this field. Completed a 1-year certificate program from University of Torronto covering the subjects like Foundations of Data Science (Pythin, NumPy, Pandas, EDA etc), Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Big Data Cencepts, in depth. 🌱 

- To supplement my learnings I also completed Machine Learning Specialization and Deep Learning Specialization from Coursera to learn some very pragmatic ways to implement the Machine Leaning algorithms to solve real world problems as well as building a deep understanding of the nitty gritty details of DNNs, CNNS and RNNs.

- 💞️  Possessing a deep mathematical acumen, vast technical experience, strong passion for Artifical Intelligence and Deep Learning, familiarity with cloud computing concepts and rich experience in working with cross functional teams, I can help organizations with tranforming the Product Developments to match the modern inductry trends.
